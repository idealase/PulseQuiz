# PulseQuiz Environment Variables
# Copy this file to .env and fill in your values

# ============================================
# AI Generation Security
# ============================================
# Required: Shared secret to protect AI generation endpoints
# Generate a random string (e.g., openssl rand -hex 32)
# This is sent as X-Auth-Token header from frontend
QUIZ_AUTH_SECRET=your-secret-here-change-me

# ============================================
# GitHub / Copilot Authentication
# ============================================
# Optional: GitHub token for API access
# If not set, the Copilot CLI will use its own authentication
# You can also set GH_TOKEN instead (used by GitHub CLI)
# GITHUB_TOKEN=ghp_your_personal_access_token

# ============================================
# Notes
# ============================================
# - The Copilot CLI must be installed for AI features to work
#   Install: https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/how-tos/set-up/install-copilot-cli
#
# - AI features include:
#   - Generate questions from topics
#   - Research Mode (web search for current events)
#   - Dynamic Mode (adaptive difficulty)
#   - Fact-check answers
#
# - Without QUIZ_AUTH_SECRET, AI endpoints are unprotected!
#   Anyone with access to your backend URL could use them.
